# **React SPA: Listen and Write**

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to load a random phrase from an API endpoint, play an audio file associated with that phrase, and submit a written response to compare their input against the original phrase, receiving detailed feedback.

### **Key Highlights of Structure**

- **`api/`**: Centralized services for interacting with APIs. Includes the Axios instance, request configuration, and backend endpoints.
- **`components/`**: Modular and reusable interface components like `Button` and `Input` for improved UI consistency.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for encapsulating API calls, data fetching, and state management.
- **`pages/`**: Houses the main pages of the app. Each folder contains components, hooks, and styles relevant to that page.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route configurations using `react-router-dom` for seamless navigation across pages.
- **`styles/`**: Includes global styles such as resets and reusable CSS variables.
- **`types/`**: Strong TypeScript typings ensure type safety across API responses and application state.

## **Running the Project**

Ensure the backend API is running locally before starting the application. You can modify the `baseURL` in `src/api/axiosInstance.ts` if necessary:

```typescript
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
    baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:5000",
    timeout: 5000,
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
});
```

To start the application:

1. Build the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the application in your browser using the specified local server URL.
